# ANSI Color Codes:
# \e[31m = Red (errors/fail)
# \e[32m = Green (success)
# \e[33m = Yellow (warnings/info)
# \e[0m  = Reset (back to normal text)

# Root user check:
# id -u â†’ prints current user's UID
# UID 0 = root user
# If not root, script exits with error

# VALIDATE function:
# Purpose: Reuse success/failure checks for commands
# $1 = exit status of previous command ($?)
# $2 = description of the action (e.g., "Installing MySQL")
# Prints colored Success/Failure message and exits on failure
